# DEVELOPMENT MiniDev Sprint 3: Memory and the First Agent

**Context ID:** MINIDEV_MEMORY_AGENT_FOUNDATION_003
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Complexity:** HIGH
**Dependencies:** Go runtime, gRPC framework, libsql database, existing Orchestrator service

## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Introduce statefulness into the system by creating an external memory service and the first specialized agent to interact with it
**Expected Outcome:** Functional memory persistence system with agent-based interaction capabilities
**Success Criteria:** System can store and retrieve information using the new MemoryService and MemoryAgent, demonstrating full memory workflow through integration tests

## Technical Specifications

### Code Requirements
- **Language:** Go
- **Framework:** gRPC-Go, libsql database driver
- **Libraries:** google.golang.org/grpc, database/sql, libsql driver
- **Patterns:** Agent pattern, repository pattern, service layer

### Quality Standards
- **Code Style:** Go standard formatting (gofmt)
- **Testing:** Unit tests for agents, integration tests for workflows
- **Documentation:** Inline comments and service documentation
- **Performance:** Efficient database operations, connection pooling

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** Secure gRPC communication
- **Authorization:** Access control for memory operations
- **Data Protection:** Secure storage of sensitive information

## Implementation Guidance

### Approach
1. **Phase 1:** Define gRPC contract and generate code
2. **Phase 2:** Implement memory service with database persistence
3. **Phase 3:** Create memory agent with gRPC client capabilities
4. **Phase 4:** Enhance orchestrator with rule-based agent management
5. **Phase 5:** Implement comprehensive integration testing

### Best Practices
- Design agents to be short-lived and stateless
- Use connection pooling for database operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use structured data formats for memory storage
- Ensure containerized deployment capability

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] .proto file defines MemoryService with SaveMemory and RetrieveMemory RPC methods
- [ ] SaveRequest, SaveResponse, RetrieveRequest, and RetrieveResponse messages are defined
- [ ] gRPC client and server code is generated from .proto file for Go
- [ ] Memory service is a gRPC server implementing MemoryService interface
- [ ] SaveMemory method saves data to libsql database successfully
- [ ] RetrieveMemory method retrieves data from libsql database correctly
- [ ] Memory service is containerized with Dockerfile
- [ ] MemoryAgent is a gRPC client for MemoryService
- [ ] MemoryAgent has functions to save and retrieve memory via service calls
- [ ] MemoryAgent is designed to be short-lived and stateless
- [ ] Orchestrator has rule-based logic to decide when to use MemoryAgent
- [ ] Orchestrator can spawn MemoryAgent based on keywords like "remember" or "recall"
- [ ] Orchestrator can provide tasks to MemoryAgent and receive results
- [ ] Integration test sends prompt "Remember that my favorite color is blue"
- [ ] Test verifies Orchestrator spawns MemoryAgent and data is saved to database
- [ ] Subsequent test retrieves information and verifies correctness

### Test Cases
1. **Test:** gRPC Contract Generation
   - **Input:** memory_service.proto file
   - **Expected:** Generated Go client and server code compiles
   - **Validation:** No compilation errors, interfaces are correct

2. **Test:** Memory Service Persistence
   - **Input:** SaveMemory request with test data
   - **Expected:** Data is stored in libsql database
   - **Validation:** Database contains saved data, RetrieveMemory returns correct data

3. **Test:** Memory Agent Functionality
   - **Input:** Memory save/retrieve operations
   - **Expected:** Agent successfully communicates with memory service
   - **Validation:** Agent returns correct responses from service calls

4. **Test:** Orchestrator Rule-Based Spawning
   - **Input:** Prompt containing "remember" keyword
   - **Expected:** Orchestrator spawns MemoryAgent
   - **Validation:** MemoryAgent is created and executes memory operation

5. **Test:** End-to-End Memory Workflow
   - **Input:** "Remember that my favorite color is blue" followed by "What is my favorite color?"
   - **Expected:** Information is saved and correctly retrieved
   - **Validation:** Second query returns "blue" as favorite color

### Integration Points
- **Memory Service:** Must provide reliable persistence layer
- **Memory Agent:** Must integrate with Orchestrator spawning mechanism
