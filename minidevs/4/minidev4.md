# TASK: Implement Cycle 4: Robustness, Scalability, and Self-Healing

**priority:** HIGH

## Executive Summary
**objective:** To transition the agentic system from a functional prototype to a production-ready, robust, and scalable platform by implementing Cycle 4 of the development plan.
**expected_outcome:** A system that includes a dynamic service registry, advanced fault tolerance, and is easily extensible with new agents and services.
**success_criteria:** All services register and deregister automatically. The system can handle transient gRPC errors gracefully. The architecture is validated to support the addition of new, specialized agents.

### Primary Task
**id:** T4
**type:** Implementation
**description:** Implement the features outlined in "Cyklus 4: Robusitet, Skalerbarhed og Selvreparerende Mekanismer" to make the system production-ready.

### Subtasks
<!-- ITEM:subtask -->
**name:** Implement Robust Service Registry
**action:** Replace the simple service registry stub with a dynamic solution like Consul or etcd.
**input:** Existing services (Orchestrator, LLM Gateway, Memory Service).
**output:** Each service automatically registers itself on startup and de-registers on shutdown.
**validation:** Verify in the Consul/etcd UI that services appear and disappear correctly.
<!-- /ITEM:subtask -->
<!-- ITEM:subtask -->
**name:** Implement Fault Tolerance and Self-Healing
**action:** Code advanced error handling for gRPC calls, including automatic retry logic for transient failures.
**input:** gRPC client calls within the Orchestrator and Agents.
**output:** The system can withstand temporary service unavailability without crashing, providing meaningful feedback to the orchestrator.
**validation:** Simulate service failures (e.g., by temporarily stopping the Memory Service) and verify that the system recovers gracefully.
<!-- /ITEM:subtask -->
<!-- ITEM:subtask -->
**name:** Expand with More Specialized Agents
**action:** Create at least one new specialized agent and a corresponding gateway service (e.g., an ImageAnalysisAgent with a service that connects to a vision model).
**input:** The existing gRPC-based architecture.
**output:** A new, functional agent and service integrated into the system.
**validation:** Run a complex prompt that requires the new agent's capabilities and verify that the orchestrator correctly delegates the task and returns the expected result.
<!-- /ITEM:subtask -->
<!-- ITEM:subtask -->
**name:** Comprehensive System Testing
**action:** Perform stress tests to ensure the entire "spindle web" of connections functions flawlessly under load.
**input:** The fully-expanded system with all services and agents.
**output:** A test report confirming system stability, performance, and reliability.
**validation:** The system handles a high volume of concurrent requests without critical failures.
<!-- /ITEM:subtask -->
<!-- ITEM:subtask -->
**name:** Refactor Gateway for Multi-Provider Support
**action:** Separate the provider-specific logic from the main gateway service. Create a new `provider` directory and move the OpenRouter implementation into its own module (`gateway/provider/openrouter/openrouter.go`). The gateway should be updated to dynamically load and manage multiple providers, making it a stateless, multi-spawn service.
**input:** The existing `gateway/main.go` implementation.
**output:** A refactored gateway with a clear separation between the core gateway logic and provider implementations. The OpenRouter logic is moved to `gateway/provider/openrouter/openrouter.go`.
**validation:** The gateway can be started with a specific provider configuration, and it correctly routes requests to that provider. The system remains functional after the refactoring.
