# DEVELOPMENT MiniDev Sprint 2: Foundational Observability

**Context ID:** MINIDEV_OBSERVABILITY_FOUNDATION_002
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Complexity:** MODERATE
**Dependencies:** Go runtime, gRPC framework, existing Orchestrator and Gateway services

## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Implement a gRPC logging interceptor to provide visibility into the communication between services, based on the strategy outlined in "Observabilitet i det Agentiske System.md"
**Expected Outcome:** Complete observability of gRPC communication with structured logging on both client and server sides
**Success Criteria:** All gRPC calls between Orchestrator and LLM Gateway are logged with detailed, structured information including request/response payloads and execution times

## Context

### System Architecture
- **Components:** Observer middleware, gRPC interceptors, existing Orchestrator and Gateway services
- **Technologies:** Go, gRPC interceptors, structured logging
- **Patterns:** Middleware pattern, cross-cutting concerns, observability

### Current State
- **Existing Code:** Working gRPC communication between Orchestrator and Gateway from Sprint 1
- **Known Issues:** No visibility into gRPC communication, difficult to debug and monitor
- **Constraints:** Must not break existing functionality, minimal performance impact

### Domain Knowledge
- **Business Logic:** Foundational capability for system observability and debugging
- **User Requirements:** Transparent system behavior for development and operations
- **Integration Points:** All gRPC services in the agentic system

## Task Definition

### Primary Task
**ID:** MINIDEV_OBSERVABILITY_FOUNDATION_002
**Type:** IMPLEMENTATION
**Description:** Create comprehensive gRPC logging infrastructure as foundational capability (Cycle 1.5)

### Subtasks
1. **Create Logging Interceptor**
   - Action: Implement gRPC middleware package with logging interceptor
   - Input: gRPC interceptor interface requirements
   - Output: /observer/middleware/interceptors/logging.go
   - Validation: Interceptor logs all required information with structured format

2. **Integrate into LLM Gateway**
   - Action: Add logging interceptor to Gateway gRPC server
   - Input: Existing Gateway server and logging interceptor
   - Output: Modified /gateway/main.go
   - Validation: Gateway logs all incoming requests and responses

3. **Integrate into Orchestrator**
   - Action: Add logging interceptor to Orchestrator gRPC client
   - Input: Existing Orchestrator client and logging interceptor
   - Output: Modified /orchestrator/main.go
   - Validation: Orchestrator logs all outgoing requests and responses

4. **Verification Testing**
   - Action: Run existing integration test and verify log output
   - Input: Sprint 1 integration test
   - Output: Structured log entries from both services
   - Validation: Logs contain correct service names, methods, payloads, and timing

## Technical Specifications

### Code Requirements
- **Language:** Go
- **Framework:** gRPC-Go interceptors
- **Libraries:** google.golang.org/grpc, structured logging library (logrus/zap)
- **Patterns:** Middleware pattern, decorator pattern

### Quality Standards
- **Code Style:** Go standard formatting (gofmt)
- **Testing:** Integration tests with log verification
- **Documentation:** Inline comments for interceptor logic
- **Performance:** Minimal overhead, async logging where possible

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** Log security-relevant events
- **Authorization:** No sensitive data in logs
- **Data Protection:** Sanitize payloads if needed

## Implementation Guidance

### Approach
1. **Phase 1:** Create reusable logging interceptor with structured output
2. **Phase 2:** Integrate interceptor into Gateway server middleware chain
3. **Phase 3:** Integrate interceptor into Orchestrator client middleware chain
4. **Phase 4:** Verify complete observability through existing tests

### Best Practices
- Use structured logging format (JSON) for machine readability
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log execution time for performance monitoring
- Implement configurable log levels
- Ensure thread-safe logging operations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Logging interceptor logs service name, method name, and request payload as JSON
- [ ] Interceptor logs response payload and status for each call
- [ ] Execution time is measured and logged for each gRPC call
- [ ] Log output is structured (JSON or key-value pairs) for easy parsing
- [ ] LLM Gateway server is initialized with logging interceptor
- [ ] Gateway logs requests and responses when receiving calls from Orchestrator
- [ ] Orchestrator gRPC client is initialized with logging interceptor
- [ ] Orchestrator logs requests and responses when calling LLM Gateway
- [ ] Integration test from Sprint 1 produces structured logs from both services
- [ ] Logs contain correct service name, method name, request, and response data

### Test Cases
1. **Test:** Interceptor Functionality
   - **Input:** gRPC call through interceptor
   - **Expected:** Structured log entry with all required fields
   - **Validation:** Log contains service, method, payload, status, and timing

2. **Test:** Gateway Integration
   - **Input:** Request to Gateway service
   - **Expected:** Gateway logs the interaction
   - **Validation:** Gateway log file contains structured entry

3. **Test:** Orchestrator Integration
   - **Input:** Orchestrator calls Gateway
   - **Expected:** Orchestrator logs the outgoing call
   - **Validation:** Orchestrator log file contains structured entry

4. **Test:** End-to-End Observability
   - **Input:** Run Sprint 1 integration test
   - **Expected:** Both services produce correlated log entries
   - **Validation:** Logs can be matched by correlation ID or timestamp

### Integration Points
- **Gateway Service:** Must log all incoming gRPC requests
- **Orchestrator Service:** Must log all outgoing gRPC requests
- **Future Services:** Interceptor must be reusable for new services
