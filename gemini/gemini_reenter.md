# Gemini Re-entry Context

To re-enter the Gemini chat session and continue where you left off, you can use one of the following methods.

## Method 1: Copy and Paste

Copy the summary below and paste it as your first message in the new Gemini session.

---

We are working on an agentic system with the following components: `orchestrator`, `gateway`, `agent`, `observer`, and `gRPC`. We have created a series of development sprints (`minidev1`, `minidev2`, and `minidev3`) located in the `/plans_and_tasks/` directory. These sprints outline the iterative development plan, starting with foundational gRPC communication, then adding observability, and finally implementing a memory service and the first agent.

## Method 2: Command-Line Pipe

If your Gemini CLI supports reading from standard input, you can use the following command in your terminal to automatically load the context. This command reads the content of this file and sends it to the Gemini CLI as if you had typed it.

```bash
cat /Users/lpm/Repo/MimerAgentic/plans_and_tasks/gemini_reenter.md | gemini
```
